## About Project

Welcome to my flashcard extension web application! This product is designed for students who are looking to study 
flashcards while watching netflix/youtube/twitch/lectures/sporting events. It was designed to use Laravel/Vue to store flashcards, and then open up the flashcards to an incoming google extension (included) that can then cycle through the flashcards on any tab. 

## Installation and Utilization

    1. Download the packages.

    2. Setup the laravel project to run on your server. See https://laravel.com/docs/7.x for a helpful tutorial.

    3. Setup the chrome extension to work on your computer. See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/
    getstarted for a helpful tutorial.

    4. Create an account, your first deck, and the questions/answers to go with it.
    
    5. Click "Play" on the deck page and copy the link provided.

    6. Insert the link into the extension on the page you wish to study from.

    7. Study! Study! Study!
